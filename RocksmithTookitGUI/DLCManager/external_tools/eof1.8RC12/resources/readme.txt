You can save files in here to be used instead of default graphics that EOF keeps in eof.dat.


Graphics:  EOF was designed with the gem graphics being 48x48, but other sizes may be suitable as long as you save the images in PCX format.  "Selected" means that the note is selected, is being moused over or is the note underneath the seek line during chart playback.  File names are not case-sensitive in Windows, but they are in Linux and probably also in Mac OS:

Fonts:  The fonts are defined as PCX image files where each glyph is white pixels with purple transparent background.  Glyphs are separated by the yellow background of the PCX file so that Allegro can distinguish them from each other.

font_times_new_roman.pcx	The main font in EOF that is used in most situations.
font_courier_new.pcx		A mono-space font used to print various text in the piano roll (timestamps, tempos, time signatures, key signatures measure numbers, beat marker arrows, capo position), the seek time next to the playback controls.
font_symbols.pcx		A font used to draw fret numbers and any special symbols used for displaying a note's applied techniques and statuses below the piano roll.


Sound effects:  The audio files are generally defined as 16 bit, mono, 44.1KHz sample rate PCM WAV.

clap.wav		The clap sound cue.
metronome.wav		The metronome sound cue.
metronome_low.wav	The metronome sound cue used for beats that are not the first beat in a measure if the "Use multi-pitch metronome" option is enabled in "Sound>Audio cues".
gridsnap.wav		The sound played when changing the grid snap or seeking by grid snap when Feedback input mode is in effect.


A background image displayed in place of the gray background behind the piano roll, 3D preview, info panel, etc:
