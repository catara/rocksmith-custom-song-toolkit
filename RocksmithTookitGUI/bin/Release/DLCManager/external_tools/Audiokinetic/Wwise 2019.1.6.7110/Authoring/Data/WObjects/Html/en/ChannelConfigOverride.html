<h2>Channel Configuration Override</h2>
<p>A list of possible channel configurations for the source, which can be selected for display in the graph view.</p>
<span class="condition" name="WwiseLite"><p>
<strong>Note</strong>: While it is still possible to use and edit a large variety of channel configurations for your source, only the full version of Wwise can actually output these configurations. Wwise LTX will always downmix higher order configurations to stereo.
</p></span>
<p>The audio waveform always has a Wwise display ordering. For 5.1, this corresponds to L + R + C + SL + SR + LFE, from top to bottom on the left side of the graph view. For Ambisonics 1st order, this corresponds to W + Y + Z + X.</p>
<p>Wwise interprets the selected channel configurations and outputs them in the graph view according to the display order. The source channel configuration can be interpreted according to any of the following file ordering varieties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SMPTE</strong>: By default, Wwise interprets the file order as SMPTE (the Microsoft standard), unless it has an ambisonics header. For 5.1, it would appear as 5.1(L,R,C,LFE,SL,SR).
<br/>However, the default is indicated in the list with Detect [channelconfig], where &ldquo;channelconfig&rdquo; indicates the detected configuration. For 5.1, it appears as Detect [5.1(L,R,C,LFE,SL,SR)].</li>
<li><strong>FuMa</strong>: By default, for Ambisonics Component Ordering, Wwise interprets the file order as FuMa. For Ambisonics 1st order, it would appear as 4(Ambisonics) (FuMa).
<br/>However, the default is indicated in the list with Detect [channelconfig], where &ldquo;channelconfig&rdquo; indicates the detected configuration. For Ambisonics 1st order, it appears as Detect [4(Ambisonics)(FuMa)].</li>
<li><strong>Anonymous</strong>: The anonymous Channel Config options simply number the channels in order of appearance for the graph view. So, an Ambisonics 1st order file would appear as 4 (Anonymous); and it just displays as 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 in the graph view. Likewise, a 5.1 file would be listed as 6 (Anonymous); and it just displays as 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 in the graph view.</li>
<li><strong>Film</strong>: Apart from ambisonic files, the alternative file orderings in the list are Film. For 5.1, it would appear as 5.1(L,C,R,SL,SR,LFE).</li>
<li><strong>AmbiX</strong>: For ambisonics, the alternative file orderings in the list are AmbiX (ACN ordering with SN3D normalization). For Ambisonics 1st order, it would appear as 4(Ambisonics)(AmbiX).</li>
</ul>
<p>Default value: 0<br/></p>
