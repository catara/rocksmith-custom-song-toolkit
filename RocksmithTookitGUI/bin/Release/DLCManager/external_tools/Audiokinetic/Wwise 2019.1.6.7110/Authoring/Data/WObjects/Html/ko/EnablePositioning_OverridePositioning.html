<h2>Listener Relative Routing</h2>
<p>When enabled, the emitter-listener association is evaluated at this Wwise object. This is typically the case with objects of the actor-mixer hierarchy.</p>
<p>Evaluating emitter-listener association is required for any game object-driven 3D positioning to occur (attenuation and spatialization).</p>
<p>Evaluating emitter-listener association has a dramatic impact on routing, as can be observed in the Voice Graph.</p>
