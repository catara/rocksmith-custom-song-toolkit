<h2>3D Spatialization</h2>
<p>해당 소스의 공간 이동이 3D 공간 내 움직임의 시뮬레이션을 위해 계산되는지의 여부를 명시합니다. When set to Position or Position + Orientation, movement of the source is reflected by a sound being heard through specific speakers within the surround environment. With Position + Orientation, the sound&rsquo;s multichannel content also rotates with respect to the relative orientations of the emitter and listener. Orientation only has an effect with multichannel input files, and spread greater than zero.</p>
<p>When set to None, the source is panned according to the Speaker Panning setting.</p>
