<p>A value of 0 means you have a completely dry signal. A value of 100 means you have a completely wet delayed signal.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This property has no effect when the delay is used in an Auxiliary Bus. In this case, the dry level of the signal is defined by the object sending to the Auxiliary Bus. The effect will process a signal 100% wet.</p>
