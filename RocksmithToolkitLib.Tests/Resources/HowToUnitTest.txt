DEVNOTE:
===================
The 'Resources' folder contents are shared and used by the toolkit 
unit tests, e.g., RocksmithToolkitLib.Tests and RocksmithToolkitGUI.Tests

Drop any CDLC file(s) into the Resources folder that you would like to use
for unit testing.  Files from different platforms may be tested together.

Change the Properties settings of each new 'Resources' file added to:
=====================================================================
Build Action = None
Copy to Output Directory = Copy always (to test) or Do not copy (to not test)


HOW TO QUICKLY RUN ALL SOLUTION UNIT TESTS
==========================================
NOTE: ReSharper must be installed in Visual Studio to run unit test.

Before committing a revision to Github, while in Debug mode ...

Right Mouse Click on 'Solution RocksmithCustomSongCreator'
then select 'Run Unit Test' from dropdown list, or use Ctrl+U,R

Select ReShaper, Windows, Unit Test Sessions to see unit test progress.
NOTE: It may be necessary to restart/reload the entire RocksmithCustomSongCreator 
Solution if all the unit test are not shown in the window (Reshaper issue/workaround).

Note: Unit tests should always be run from Debug mode because the
RocksmithToolkit*.Test projects are only built while in Debug mode.

<WARNING>: The GameVersion must be properly set in the ConfigRepository when testing
           Xbox360 CDLC.  RS1 and RS2014 Xbox360 CDLC can not be tested together.
